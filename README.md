A modern, light, 100% type-safe, and easy-to-use unofficial API wrapper for [FakeYou](https://fakeyou.com/). Get your app up and running with FakeYou in minutes!

## Installation

Node v18 and higher is supported.

```bash
npm install fakeyou.ts
```

`package.json` must include:

```json
{
    "type": "module"
}
```

If you use TypeScript `tsconfig.json` must include:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "NodeNext"
    }
}
```

## Text-to-speech usage

```ts
import Client from "fakeyou.ts";

const client = new Client();

await client.login({
    username: "your username",
    password: "your password",
});

const model = await client.ttsModel.fetchModelByToken("TM:4e2xqpwqaggr");
const audio = await model?.infer("hello!");

await audio.toDisk("./local/name.wav"); // or toBuffer, toBase64 or just the raw URL!
```

## Or voice-to-voice!

Fakeyou.ts is the only Node package to support voice-to-voice!

```ts
import Client from "fakeyou.ts";
import { readFileSync } from "node:fs";

const client = new Client();

await client.login({
    username: "your username",
    password: "your password",
});

const model = await client.v2vModel.fetchModelByToken("vcm_tes015h65n6h");
const audioFile = readFileSync("./localAudioFile.wav"); // Wav is only supported for simplicity, as validating the type is not reliable
const audio = await model?.infer(audioFile);

await audio?.toDisk("./local/name.wav"); // Same API as TTS!
```

## TTS Rate limiting

Let the client take away the stress of rate limiting with text-to-speech. Using the below approach with `Promise.all()` it will automatically and safely queue each inference so you aren't accidentally rate limited. It is important to note that the more you add, the longer it will take to complete your request (especially if you are not logged in)!

```ts
const [audio1, audio2, audio3] = await Promise.all([
    model.infer("Test!"),
    model.infer("test 2"),
    model.infer("Test! 3"),
]);

// Do what you like with the audio files from here on!
```

_Voice-to-voice rate limiting is not yet supported_

## Q&A

### My project uses CommonJS (`require` instead of `import`), will this package work?

No. This package is meant to be used with bleeding-edge JS, to keep things standardized and simple!

### My project uses ESModule syntax, but compiles to CommonJS in post, will this package work?

If the resulting code is CommonJS this package will not be compatible.

### Do you plan to support CommonJS?

No, sorry. ðŸ˜” Projects nowadays should be looking to move away from the legacy CommonJS module system. If you use TypeScript or another transpilation tool, you may be able to convert your project to ESModules and interoperate with CommonJS packages (in TypeScript there is the `esModuleInterop` flag you can set to true). Or you can dynamically import this package with `await import()`.

### Will this work with my JS-only project?

Yes! You still get all of the types out of the box even with JS, but you won't be able to take full advantage of the amazing benefits of types.

### Do I need to log in to my FakeYou account to use this package?

It's totally optional. You can still request TTS, but you will be missing out on any premium benefits and linking your TTS history to your account.

### What versions of Node.js do you support?

Node.js v18 and up are the only versions of Node.js that this package supports. You will know if you have an invalid version, because npm will say `EBADENGINE` upon install!

### Does it work in the browser?

No, unfortunately. ðŸ˜” It is best you create your own web server that uses this package to build your app.
